# GAGHL_AVR_BUTTON_HANDLER

**A Simple external interrupt button handler for AVR microcontrollers**

GAGHL_AVR_BUTTON_HANDLER is a simple and efficient button state manager designed for AVR microcontrollers.
It uses external interrupts to detect button presses, holds, and releases with minimal CPU overhead, making it ideal for low-power or responsive applications.



## 📦 Features

- ✅ External interrupt (EXTI) based button event detection
- ✅ Detects Pressed, Hold, and Released states
- ✅ Supports multiple buttons (up to 8)
- ✅ Non-blocking event polling for smooth main loop operation
- ✅ Small memory footprint and simple API


## 📚 API Overview

| Function                     | Parameters | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `button_handler_init()`      | *(void)*   | Configures pins and enables external interrupts for buttons                                |
| `button_handler()`           | *(void)*   | Checks button events and calls the corresponding user functions (place in while(1))        |
| `button'0..7'_pressed()`     | *(void)*   | Called when button '0..7' is pressed (weak, can be overridden by user)                     |
| `button'0..7'_hold()`        | *(void)*   | Called when button '0..7' is held down (weak, can be overridden)                           |
| `button'0..7'_released()`    | *(void)*   | Called when button '0..7' is released (weak, can be overridden)                            |



## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Add the files to your project

Copy these files into your AVR project:

- `GAGHL_AVR_BUTTON_HANDLER.c`
- `GAGHL_AVR_BUTTON_HANDLER.h`
- `GAGHL_AVR_BUTTON_HANDLER_Pins.h`

### 2. Example
```c

#include <avr/io.h>
#include "GAGHL_AVR_BUTTON_HANDLER.h"

int main (void) {
	
    DDRA = 0x07;
	
	button_handler_init();
	
    while (1) {
		button_handler();
    }
}

void button0_pressed(void) {
	PORTA |= (1 << PA0);
}

void button0_hold(void) {
	PORTA |= (1 << PA1);
}

void button0_released(void) {
	PORTA |= (1 << PA2);
}

```

## 🔧 Requirements

- AVR microcontroller
- AVR-GCC or any compatible C toolchain

## 🛠️ TODO

- [ ] Add support for pin-change interrupts (PCINT)
- [ ] Configurable active-low / active-high button modes
- [ ] Optional software filtering for noisy environments
- [ ] Add unit tests or Proteus simulation examples
